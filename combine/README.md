# To-Do List
Here is the flow we can do to compute the list we want (sequence vs sample)

## 1. Create the master list of all sequence/PTM

- put all sequence (combine sick and health) together, remove the duplicate

- this list will become the key for the merging program

## 2. Using the merging program attached, 

- merge each file base on the peptide key from step 1

- right now we will need to do it one by one, 50 time, to generate the big master list (but it will not take too long for each step)

## But, at the end, what we really want is the PTM@position for each raw, and sample# for each column.

Download and run the contents of the "package" folder for a demonstration

## To Do
- Create the master list of all sequence/PTM
-- put all sequence (combine sick and health) together, remove the duplicate
-- this list will become the key for the merging program
- Using the merging program attached, 
-- merge each file base on the peptide key from step 1
-- right now we will need to do it one by one, 50 time, to generate the big master list (but it will not take too long for each step)
- But, at the end, what we really want is the PTM@position for each raw, and sample# for each column.
